# ML Resume Keyword Optimizer

A practical web tool designed for Computer Science students specializing in Machine Learning and Cloud Computing to optimize their resumes for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) and technical roles.

## Features
- **Keyword Analysis**: Scans resume text for critical ML and SDE keywords (Python, Scikit-learn, AWS, Big-O, etc.).
- **JD Comparison**: Allows pasting a specific Job Description to identify missing high-priority skills.
- **Actionable Suggestions**: Provides specific advice on what to add based on industry trends (2026).
- **Client-Side Only**: Your resume data stays in your browser.

## Why this matters
As a 3rd-year CS student targeting top tech firms (Infosys, Accenture, Capgemini), having the right technical keywords is the first step to passing the initial screening phase. This tool bridges the gap between raw skills and ATS visibility.
